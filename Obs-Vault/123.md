## Keywords

-   Opportunity cost
-   _Economic_ profit & _accounting_ profit
-   Present value analysis
    -   Net present value
    -   Single future value
    -   Stream of future values
-   Marginal analysis

## Opportunity Cost

> [!definition] Opportunity Cost
> The opportunity cost of any item is whatever must be **given up** to obtain it.
> Consists of two components:
>
> -   Explicit cost: (accounting) cost of a resource
> -   Implicit cost: cost of giving up the best alternative use of that resource

---

## Profits

> [!definition] **Accounting** Profit
> Total amount of money taken in from sales (total revenue) minus the explicit costs of producing the goods or services sold.

$$ \boxed{\text{Accounting Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Explicit Costs}} $$

> [!definition] **Economic** Profit
> Difference between total revenue and the **opportunity cost** of resources used.

$$
\begin{align*}
\boxed{\text{Economic Profit}} &= \boxed{\text{Total Revenue} - \text{Opportunity Cost}} \\
&= \text{Total Revenue} - \text{(Explicit Costs + Implicit Costs)} \\
&= \text{Accounting Profit} - \text{Implicit Costs}
\end{align*}
$$

## Market

> [!definition] Market
> The market is the place for the two sides (buyer and seller) to make transactions.

**Bargaining** is the process of arriving at a price and quantity for a good or service.
It is limited by three rivalries:

1. Consumer-producer rivalry
2. Consumer-consumer rivalry
3. Producer-producer rivalry

---

## Present Value Analysis

Often a gap exists between the time when costs are borne and benefits are received.

> [!definition] Present Value of a Single Future Value
> Given
>
> -   **Prevailing interest rate** $i$
> -   **Number of periods** $n$
> -   **Future value** $FV$
>
> The amount that would have to be invested today is the **present value** $PV$.

The present value reflects the difference between the **future value FV** and the **opportunity cost of waiting OCW**.

> [!formula] Present Value as Future Value minus Opportunity Cost of Waiting
> $$ \boxed{PV = FV - \text{OCW}} $$

### _Single_ future value

> [!formula] Present Value of a Single Future Value
> $$ \boxed{PV = \frac{FV}{(1+i)^n}} $$

### _Stream_ of future values

> [!formula] Present Value of a Stream of Future Values
>
> $$
> \boxed{PV = \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{FV_t}{(1+i)^t}}
> $$

### Net Present Value

The present value of the _income stream_ generated by a project, minus the current cost of the project.

> [!formula] Net Present Value
>
> $$
> \boxed{NPV = PV - C_0} = \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{FV_t}{(1+i)^t} - C_0
> $$
>
> Where $C_0$ is the current cost of the project.

---

## Marginal Analysis

-   $Q$ = control variable (e.g., quantity produced)
-   $B(Q)$ = total benefit
-   $C(Q)$ = total cost
-   $NB(Q)$ = net benefit

The manager's objective is to maximize the net benefits.

> [!formula] Net Benefit
> $$ \boxed{NB(Q) = B(Q) - C(Q)} $$

We use marginal analysis to maximize net benefits.

-   $MB(Q)$ = marginal benefit = $\frac{dB(Q)}{dQ}$
-   $MC(Q)$ = marginal cost = $\frac{dC(Q)}{dQ}$
-   $MNB(Q)$ = marginal net benefit = $\frac{dNB(Q)}{dQ}$

> [!formula] Marginal Net Benefit
> $$ \boxed{MNB(Q) = MB(Q) - MC(Q)} $$

> [!rule] Marginal Principle
> To **maximize net benefits** $NB(Q)$, a manager should increase the control variable $Q$ as long as the marginal net benefit $MNB(Q)$ is positive, and up to the point where $$\text{Maximum net benefits} \iff MNB(Q) = 0 \iff \boxed{MB(Q) = MC(Q)}$$

---

## Incremental Decisions

> [!definition] Incremental Revenues
> Additional revenues that stem from a yes-or-no decision.

> [!definition] Incremental Costs
> Additional costs that stem from a yes-or-no decision.

> [!rule] Incremental Decision Rule
>
> -   Thumbs up if $MB > MC$
> -   Thumbs down if $MB < MC$

---

## Positive and Normative Analysis

> [!definition] Positive Analysis
> Statements that describe the relationship of cause and effect.
> "What will be the **impact** **of** ...?"

> [!definition] Normative Analysis
> Analysis examining questions of what ought to be (= value judgments).
> "**Should** the government ...?"

Economists use **models** to study economic issues. A model is a **highly simplified representation of a more complicated reality**. The most basic model in economics is the **supply and demand model**.

---

## Supply and Demand

> [!definition] Demand
> The **quantity demanded** $Q^d$ of a good is the amount of good that **consumers are willing and able to purchase**.

> [!law] Law of Demand
> The **quantity demanded** of a good **increases** as the **price falls**.
> So, **price and quantity demanded are inversely related**.

## Supply

> [!definition] Supply
> The **quantity supplied** of any good is the **amount that sellers are willing and able to sell**

> [!law] Law of Supply
> The **quantity supplied** $Q^s$ of a good **increases** as the **price rises** (holding all else constant).
> So, **price and quantity supplied are directly related**.

---

## Market supply/demand Curve

-   illustrates the relationship between the total quantity demanded/supplied and the price of a good
-   holding **all other variables constant**
-   $Q$ on the **horizontal** axis
-   $P$ on the **vertical** axis

---

## Willingness to Pay

> [!definition] Willingness to Pay (WTP)
> A consumer's **Willingness to Pay (WTP)** for a good is the **maximum amount the buyer will pay** for that good.
> It reflects how much the buyer values the good.

## Willingness to Sell

> [!definition] Willingness to Sell (WTS)
> A producer's **Willingness to Sell (WTS)** for a good is the **minimum amount the seller will accept** for that good.
> It reflects how much the seller values the good.

---

## Changes in Demand and Supply

> [!law] Changes in Demand/Supply
>
> Changing **<u>only price</u>**:
>
> -   Leads to changes in **<u>quantity</u> demanded $Q^d$ / <u>quantity</u> supplied $Q^s$**
> -   Movement _along_ the demand/supply curve
>
> Changing **<u>other variables</u>**:
>
> -   Leads to changes in **<u>demand/supply</u>**
> -   **Shifts** the _entire_ demand/supply curve

---

## Demand Shifters

### Income

> [!definition] Normal good
> A **normal good** is a good for which an **increase in income causes an increase in demand**.
> $$\boxed{\text{Demand} \uparrow \text{ when Income} \uparrow}$$

_E.g. fruits, clothing, electronics_

> [!definition] Inferior good
> An **inferior good** is a good for which an **increase in income causes a decrease in demand**.
> $$\boxed{\text{Demand} \downarrow \text{ when Income} \uparrow}$$

_E.g. instant noodles, bus rides, used cars_

### Related Goods

> [!definition] Substitutes
> Two goods are **substitutes** if an **increase in the price of one causes an increase in demand for the other**.
> $$\boxed{\text{Demand of Good A} \uparrow \text{ when Price of Good B} \uparrow}$$

_E.g. butter and margarine, tea and coffee, Coke and Pepsi_

> [!definition] Complements
> Two goods are **complements** if an **increase in the price of one causes a decrease in demand for the other**.
> $$\boxed{\text{Demand of Good A} \downarrow \text{ when Price of Good B} \uparrow}$$

_E.g. cars and gasoline, printers and ink cartridges, smartphone and apps_

### Other demand shifters

-   Advertising and consumer tastes
-   Population (e.g. age distribution, demographics)
-   Expectations about future prices and income

## Supply Shifters

-   Input prices
    -   Wage $r$
    -   Price of raw materials
-   Technology
-   Government regulation
-   Number of firms (entry and exit)
-   Taxes

---

## Consumer Surplus

> [!definition] Consumer Surplus (CS)
> The **consumer surplus** is the difference between the maximum amount a consumer is willing to pay for a good and the amount the consumer actually pays for it.
> It measures the benefit to consumers from participating in the market.
> $$\boxed{CS = \text{(value to buyers)} - \text{(amount paid by buyers)}} = \text{buyers's gains from particip.}$$
> It equals the **area below the demand curve and above the price**, from $0$ to $Q^d$.

> [!formula] Consumer Surplus (CS)
> $$ \boxed{CS = WTP - P}$$

> [!definition] Total Consumer Value
> Sum of the WTP's at different quantities.
>
> $$
> \text{Total Consumer Value} = \int_{0}^{Q^d} WTP(Q) \, dQ
> $$

> [!definition] Total Expenditure
> Per-unit market price times number of units purchased.
> $$ \text{Total Expenditure} = P \times Q^d $$

> [!formula] Consumer Surplus as Total Consumer Value minus Total Expenditure
>
> $$
> \boxed{CS = \text{Total Consumer Value} - \text{Total Expenditure}}
> $$

Two reasons for fall in CS when price rises:

1. Some consumers leave the market (lower $Q^d$)
2. Remaining consumers pay a higher price (higher $P$)

## Producer Surplus

> [!definition] Producer Surplus (PS)
> The **producer surplus** is the amount producers receive in excess of the amount necessary to induce them to produce the good.
> $$\boxed{PS = \text{(amount received by sellers)} - \text{(cost to sellers)}} = \text{sellers's gains from particip.}$$
> It equals the **area above the supply curve and below the price**, from $0$ to $Q^s$.

Two reasons for fall in PS when price falls:

1. Some sellers leave the market (lower $Q^s$)
2. Remaining sellers receive a lower price (lower $P$)

## Total surplus

> [!definition] Total Surplus (TS)
> The **total surplus** is the total gains from trade in a market.
> $$\boxed{TS = CS + PS = \text{(value to buyers)} - \text{(cost to sellers)}}$$

-   We use total surplus as a measure of **society's well-being** or **social welfare**.
-   We consider whether the market's allocation is **efficient** = **maximizes total surplus**.

> [!rule]
> The market's allocation is **efficient** if it **maximizes total surplus**.

---

## Demand Function

### Linear Demand Function

A linear demand function has the form:

$$
\boxed{Q_X^d = \alpha_0 + \alpha_X P_X + \alpha_Y P_Y + \alpha_M M + \alpha_H H}
$$

Where

-   $Q_X^d$ = quantity demanded of good $X$
-   $P_X$ = price of good $X$
-   $Y$ = **related good**
-   $P_Y$ = price of related good $Y$
-   $M$ = **income**
-   $H$ = value of **any other variable affecting demand** (demand shifter)

### Inverse Demand Function

If we express$$
\boxed{P_X \text{ as a function of } Q_X^d}$$we obtain the **inverse demand function**.

## Supply Function

### Linear Supply Function

A linear supply function has the form:

$$
\boxed{Q_X^s = \beta_0 + \beta_X P_X + \beta_W W + \beta_r P_r + \beta_H H}
$$

-   $Q_X^s$ = number of units of good $X$ produced
-   $P_X$ = price of good $X$
-   $W$ = **price of an input**
-   $P_r$ = price of a **technologically related goods**
-   $H$ = value of **any other variable affecting supply** (supply shifter)

### Inverse Supply Function

If we express$$
\boxed{P_X \text{ as a function of } Q_X^s}$$we obtain the **inverse supply function**.

---

## Taxes

> [!definition] Excise Tax
> An **excise tax** is a tax that is a **fixed amount per unit sold**.
> _E.g. tax on cigarettes_

> [!definition] Ad Valorem Tax
> An **ad valorem tax** is a tax that is a **percentage of the price of the good**.
> _E.g. VAT (value-added tax)_

---

## Market Equilibrium

> [!definition] Market Equilibrium
> A market is in **equilibrium** when the **quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied**.
> $$ \boxed{Q^e = Q^d = Q^s} $$
> A price and quantity such that there is **no shortage** and **no surplus** (excess supply) in the market.
> The equilibrium price $P^e$ is the price at which the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied.

Forces that drive market demand and supply are balanced: there is no pressure on prices or quantities to change.

> [!rule] Market Equilibrium Maximizes Total Surplus
> **The market equilibrium maximizes total surplus**, and therefore the **allocation of resources is efficient**.

---

## Price ceilings and Price floors

> [!definition] Price Ceiling
> A **price ceiling** is a legal maximum on the price at which a good can be sold.
> _E.g. rent control_

> [!definition] Price Floor
> A **price floor** is a legal minimum on the price at which a good can be sold.
> _E.g. minimum wage_

### Changes in demand

_E.g. flowers and chocolates on Valentine's Day_

Increase in demand only:

-   Equilibrium price $P^e$ increases
-   Equilibrium quantity $Q^e$ increases

Decrease in demand only:

-   Equilibrium price $P^e$ decreases
-   Equilibrium quantity $Q^e$ decreases

### Changes in supply

_E.g. egg crisis in the US_

Increase in supply only:

-   Equilibrium price $P^e$ decreases
-   Equilibrium quantity $Q^e$ increases

Decrease in supply only:

-   Equilibrium price $P^e$ increases
-   Equilibrium quantity $Q^e$ decreases

## Competitive Market

> [!definition] Competitive Market
> A **competitive market** is a market with many buyers and sellers, each of whom has a negligible impact on the market price.

## Elasticity

> [!definition] Elasticity
> A measure of responsiveness of one variable to changes in another variable.
> The **percentage change** in one variable resulting from a **1% change** in another variable.
> It is a **unit-free** measure.

> [!formula] General Formula for Elasticity
> In general, the elasticity between two variables $G$ and $S$ is given by:
>
> $$
> \boxed{E_{G,S} = \frac{\%\Delta G}{\%\Delta S}} = \frac{d G / G}{d S / S} = \boxed{\frac{d G}{d S} \cdot \frac{S}{G}}
> $$

---

## Own Price Elasticity of Demand

> [!definition] Price Elasticity of Demand
> The **price elasticity of demand** measures the responsiveness of a percentage change in quantity demanded of a good $X$ to a 1% change in its own price $P_X$.

> [!formula] Price Elasticity of Demand
> $$\boxed{E_{Q_X^d,P_X} = \frac{\%\Delta Q_X^d}{\%\Delta P_X} = \frac{d Q_X^d}{d P_X} \cdot \frac{P_X}{Q_X^d}}$$
> By **law of demand**,
> $$\boxed{E_{Q_X^d,P_X} < 0}$$

> [!rule] Categories of Price Elasticity of Demand
>
> $$
> \begin{align*}
> \textbf{Elastic demand}:&& |E_{Q_X^d,P_X}| > 1 \\
> \textbf{Unitary elastic demand}:&& |E_{Q_X^d,P_X}| = 1 \\
> \textbf{Inelastic demand}:&& |E_{Q_X^d,P_X}| < 1 \\
> \end{align*}
> $$

### Graphical Interpretation (demand curve)

The price elasticity of demand is closely related to the slope of the demand curve.

> [!rule]
> The **flatter** the curve, the **bigger** the elasticity (in absolute value).
> The **steeper** the curve, the **smaller** the elasticity (in absolute value).

> [!rule]
>
> **<u>Horizontal</u>** demand curve
>
> -   $E_{Q_X^d,P_X} = \frac{d Q_X^d}{d P_X} \cdot \frac{P_X}{Q_X^d} = -\infty$
> -   **Perfectly <u>elastic</u> demand**
> -   Horizontal demand curve
>
> **<u>Vertical</u>** demand curve
>
> -   $E_{Q_X^d,P_X} = \frac{d Q_X^d}{d P_X} \cdot \frac{P_X}{Q_X^d} = 0$
> -   **Perfectly <u>inelastic</u> demand**
> -   Vertical demand curve

!! Note that **elasticity varies along a linear demand curve** !!

### Factors affecting Price Elasticity of Demand

1. **Availability of substitutes**:
    - More substitutes $\to$ more elastic demand
        - Because consumers can easily switch to another good if the price of the good rises
    - _Broad_ vs _narrow_ definition
        - Narrowly defined $\to$ more elastic demand because more substitutes
        - Broadly defined $\to$ more inelastic demand because fewer substitutes
2. **Time horizon**:
    - E.g. gasoline
        - Short run: inelastic demand because few substitutes
        - Long run: elastic demand because more substitutes (e.g. electric cars, public transport)
3. **Necessities vs luxuries**:
    - Necessities $\to$ inelastic demand
    - Luxuries $\to$ elastic demand
    - _E.g. insulin vs vacations_
4. **Expenditure share**:
    - Small expenditure share $\to$ inelastic demand
    - Large expenditure share $\to$ elastic demand (price increase of a good with a large expenditure share significantly affects the consumer's budget, leading to a larger change in quantity demanded.)
    - _E.g. salt vs cars_

## Price Elasticity and Total Revenue

Recall that
$$ \text{Total Revenue} = P \times Q^d $$
The effect of a price change on total revenue **depends on the price elasticity of demand**.

> [!rule] Effect of Price Change on Total Revenue

>
> Demand $D$ is **<u>inelastic</u>**

>
> Demand $D$ is **<u>unitary elastic</u>**
>
> -   $|E_{Q_X^d,P_X}| = 1$
> -   **Total revenue is maximized**
> -   $\boxed{\text{Price} \uparrow \quad \Longrightarrow \quad \text{Total Revenue} \text{ unchanged}}$

---

## Cross-Price Elasticity

> [!definition] Cross-Price Elasticity
> The **cross-price elasticity** measures the responsiveness of a percentage change in quantity demanded of a good $X$ to a 1% change in the price of another good $Y$.

> [!formula] Cross-Price Elasticity
> $$\boxed{E_{Q_X^d,P_Y} = \frac{\%\Delta Q_X^d}{\%\Delta P_Y} = \frac{d Q_X^d}{d P_Y} \cdot \frac{P_Y}{Q_X^d}}$$

> [!rule] Categories of Cross-Price Elasticity

> $$
> \begin{align*}
> \textbf{Substitutes}:&& E_{Q_X^d,P_Y} > 0 \\
> \textbf{Complements}:&& E_{Q_X^d,P_Y} < 0 \\
> \textbf{Unrelated goods}:&& E_{Q_X^d,P_Y} = 0 \\
> \end{align*}
> $$

## Income Elasticity

> [!definition] Income Elasticity
> The **income elasticity** measures the responsiveness of a percentage change in quantity demanded of a good $X$ to a 1% change in **income $M$.**

> [!formula] Income Elasticity
> $$\boxed{E_{Q_X^d,M} = \frac{\%\Delta Q_X^d}{\%\Delta M}}$$

> [!rule] Categories of Income Elasticity

> \textbf{Normal good}:&& E_{Q_X^d,M} > 0 \\
> \textbf{Inferior good}:&& E_{Q_X^d,M} < 0 \\
> \end{align*}
> $$

---

## Other Elasticities

> [!definition] (Own) Advertising Elasticity
> The **(own) advertising elasticity** of demand for good $X$ is the ratio of the percentage change in the consumption of $X$ to the percentage change in advertising expenditure on $X$.

> [!definition] Cross-Advertising Elasticity between Goods $X$ and $Y$
> The **cross-advertising elasticity** between goods $X$ and $Y$ would measure the percentage change in the consumption of good $X$ resulting from a 1% change in advertising expenditure on good $Y$.

---

## Elasticities for (Non-)Linear Demand Functions

### Linear Demand Function

Given a linear demand function:
$$Q_X^d = \alpha_0 + \alpha_X P_X + \alpha_Y P_Y + \alpha_M M + \alpha_H H$$

We have

$$
\begin{align*}
\textbf{Own price elasticity:} & \alpha_X \cdot \frac{P_X}{Q_X^d} \\
\textbf{Cross-price elasticity:} & \alpha_Y \cdot \frac{P_Y}{Q_X^d} \\
\textbf{Income elasticity:} & \alpha_M \cdot \frac{M}{Q_X^d} \\
\end{align*}
$$

### Log-Linear Demand Function

One non-linear demand function is the **log-linear demand function**:
$$ \boxed{\ln Q_X^d = \beta_0 + \beta_X \ln P_X + \beta_Y \ln P_Y + \beta_M \ln M + \beta_H \ln H} $$

We have

$$
\begin{align*}
\textbf{Own price elasticity:} & \beta_X \\
\textbf{Cross-price elasticity:} & \beta_Y \\
\textbf{Income elasticity:} & \beta_M \\
\end{align*}
$$

## Econometrics

> [!definition] Econometrics
> Econometrics is about how we can use theory and data from economics, business and the social sciences, along with tools from statistics, to **answer "how much" questions**.

An economic model consists of

-   **systematic part**
-   **random, unpredictable component** $e$ = **random error**

---

## Linear Regression

Trivial.
