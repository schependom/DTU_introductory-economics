## Gross Domestic Product (GDP)

> [!definition] Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
> Two definitions:
>
> -   Total **expenditure** on **domestically produced final goods and services**
> -   Total **income** earned by **domestically located factors of production**

> [!rule] GDP Measurement Equivalence
> $$\text{GDP} = \text{Total Expenditure} = \text{Total Income}$$
> because every dollar spent by a buyer is a dollar of income for a seller.

It does **not** measure well-being or prosperity.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{GDP} &= \text{value of final goods produced (total output)} \\
&= \text{sum of value added at all stages of production}\\
&= \text{total income}\\
&= \text{total expenditures}
\end{aligned}
$$

### Expenditure Components of GDP

-   $C$ = Consumption
-   $I$ = Investment
-   $G$ = Government Purchases
-   $NX$ = Net Exports (Exports - Imports)

> [!formula] GDP Expenditure Formula
> $$\boxed{\underbrace{Y}_\text{value of total output} = \underbrace{C + I + G + NX}_{\text{total expenditure}}}$$

The net exports represents the spending on domestically produced goods by foreigners minus the spending on foreign produced goods by domestic residents.

## Gross National Product (GNP)

> [!definition] Gross National Product (GNP)
> Total income earned by the nation's factors of production, _regardless of where located_.

> [!definition] Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
> Total income earned by **domestically located** factors of production, _regardless of nationality_.

> [!formula] GNP and GDP Relationship
> $$\boxed{\text{GNP} - \text{GDP} = \text{factor payments \textbf{from} abroad} - \text{factor payments \textbf{to} abroad}}$$

## Nominal vs. Real GDP

GDP is the value of all final goods and services produced

> [!definition] Nominal GDP
> Measures GDP using **current prices**.

> [!definition] Real GDP
> Measures GDP using the **prices of a base year**.

$$RGDP_t = \sum_i P_{i}^{\text{base}} Q_{it}$$

---

## GDP Deflator

> [!definition] Inflation rate
> The percentage increase in the overall level of prices.

One **measure of price level** is the **GDP deflator**.

> [!formula] GDP Deflator
> $$\boxed{\text{GDP Deflator} = 100 \cdot \frac{\text{Nominal GDP}}{\text{Real GDP}}\%}$$

We can deconstruct the GDP deflator to see that it is a **weighed average of prices**.
The weight on each price reflects that good's relative importance in GDP.
**Weights change over time.**

$$GDP \text{ Deflator}_t = \frac{NGDP_t}{RGDP_t} = \frac{\sum_i P_{it} Q_{it}}{RGDP_t} = \sum_i \left(\frac{Q_{it}}{RGDP_t}\right)P_{it}$$

---

## Consumer Price Index (CPI)

> [!definition] Consumer Price Index (CPI)
> A measure of the overall level of prices tracking changes in the typical household's cost of living.

> [!formula] Consumer Price Index (CPI)
> $$\boxed{\text{CPI} = 100 \cdot \frac{\text{Cost of basket in that month}}{\text{Cost of basket in base period}}}$$

We can once again deconstruct the CPI to see that it is a **weighed average of prices**.
The weight on each price reflects that good's relative importance in the CPI's basket.
Weights are **fixed over time.**

$$CPI_t = \frac{E_t}{E_b} = \frac{\sum_i P_{it} Q_{i}^{\text{base}}}{E_b} = \sum_i \left(\frac{Q_{i}^{\text{base}}}{E_b}\right)P_{it}$$

## Categories of Population

-   **Employed**
-   **Unemployed**
    -   Not employed
    -   But looking for work
-   **Labor Force**
    -   Employed + Unemployed
    -   Amount of labor available for producing goods and services
-   **Not in Labor Force**
    -   Not employed
    -   Not looking for work

> [!formula] Unemployment Rate
> Percentage of labor force (employed + unemployed) that is unemployed.
> $$\text{Unemployment Rate} = 100 \cdot \frac{\text{Number of Unemployed}}{\text{Labor Force}}$$

> [!formula] Labor Force Participation Rate
> Fraction of the adult population that "participates" in the labor force (working or looking for work).
> $$\text{Labor Force Participation Rate} = 100 \cdot \frac{\text{Labor Force}}{\text{\color{red}Adult\color{white} Population}}$$

## Unemployment Types

1. **Structural Unemployment**
    - Mismatch between skills of workers and requirements of jobs
    - _e.g._ AI replacing human jobs
2. **Frictional Unemployment**
    - Time it takes to match workers with jobs
3. **Cyclical Unemployment**
    - Caused by economic downturns

## Small closed economy model

Assumptions:

-   closed economoy

## Distribution of National Income

Determined by factor prices

## Supply Side

Assume that markets are competitive. Each firm takes $W$, $R$ and $P$ as given.

A firm hires each unit of labor $L$ at cost $W/P$ if that cost $W/P$ does not exceed the benefit (marginal product of labor) of hiring that unit of labor.

> [!formula] Marginal Product of Labor (MPL)
> The increase in output from an additional unit of labor, holding the amount of capital fixed:

In a Cobb-Douglas production function, the shares of labor and capital income are constant.

We assume that government spending $G$ and total taxes $T$ are **exogenous**:$$G = \bar{G} \quad , \quad T = \bar{T}$$

## Money

> [!definition] Money supply
> **Money supply** $M$ = quantity of money available in the economy.

> [!definition] Money policy
> **Monetary policy** = the control over the money supply
> Conducted by the country's **central bank**

To control the money supply, the central bank uses **open-market operations**: the purchase and sale of government bonds.

> [!definition] Currency
> **Currency** $C$ = paper bills and coins in the hands of the public.

> [!formula]
> The money supply $M$ equals the sum of currency $C$ and demand (checking account) deposits $D$:
> $$\boxed{M = C + D}$$

The total Money Supply ($M$) is the sum of currency and demand deposits.

-   $C$, **Currency**: The **physical money** (e.g., notes and coins) held by the non-bank public.
-   $D$, **Demand Deposits**: Funds held in **bank accounts** that can be **accessed "on demand"** (i.e., immediately and without notice).

**Checking Accounts** is a common term for demand deposits, allowing funds to be withdrawn via checks, debit cards, or electronic transfers.

### Reserves

> [!definition] Reserves
> **Reserves** $R$ = portion of deposits that banks have to lent.

A bank's liabilities (= what it owes) include deposits $D$.
A bank's assets (= what it owns) include reserves $R$ and outstanding loans $L$.

Two types of reserve banking:

-   **100-percent-reserve banking**: banks keep all deposits as reserves
-   **Fractional-reserve banking**: banks keep only a fraction of deposits as reserves and

> [!definition] Reserve Ratio
> **Reserve ratio** $rr$ = fraction of deposits that banks hold as reserves.

> [!formula] Total money supply
> $$\text{Total money supply} = \text{Initial deposit} \times \frac{1}{rr}$$

### Exogenous Variables

Exogenous means determined outside the model.

> [!formula] Monetary Base
> $$\text{Monetary Base } \boxed{B = C + R}$$
> Where $C$ = currency in circulation and $R$ = bank reserves.
> Controlled by the central bank.

> [!formula] Reserve-deposit ratio
> $$\text{Reserve-deposit ratio } \boxed{rr = \frac{R}{D}}$$
> depends on regulatios and bank policies.

> [!formula] Currency-deposit ratio
> $$\text{Currency-deposit ratio } \boxed{cr = \frac{C}{D}}$$
> depends on preferences of households.

> [!formula] Money Multiplier
> Money multiplier $m$, the increase in the money supply $M$ resulting from a one-dollar increase in the monetary base $B$ (= $C + R$):
> $$\boxed{m = \frac{1 + cr}{rr + cr}}$$

> [!formula] Money supply in terms of base
> $$\boxed{M = m \cdot B}$$

If monetary base $B = C + R$ increases changes by $\Delta B$, then money supply $M$ changes by $\Delta M = m \cdot \Delta B$.

# Part 2

## Quantity Theory of Money

> [!definition] Quantity Theory of Money
> A simple theory linking the **inflation rate** to the **growth rate of the money supply** $M$.

## Velocity of Money

-   $V$ = velocity of money
-   $T$ = **value of all transactions**
-   $M$ = money supply

> [!formula] Velocity of Money
> $$\boxed{V = \frac{T}{M}}$$

If we use nominal GDP $NGDP$ as a proxy for value of all transactions $T$, then

> [!formula] Velocity of Money (using NGDP)
> $$\boxed{V = \frac{P \cdot Y}{M}}$$
> where
>
> -   $P$ = price of output (GDP deflator)
> -   $Y$ = quantity of output (real GDP)
> -   $P \cdot Y$ = nominal GDP

> [!formula] NGDP
> $$\boxed{NGDP = P \cdot Y = \text{GDP deflator} \times \text{real GDP}}$$

Thus, we have that $M \cdot V = T = P \cdot Y$.

> [!formula] Quantity Equation
> $$\boxed{M \cdot V = P \cdot Y}$$
> This is an **identity**: it holds by definition of the variables.
> It says that the money supply times the velocity of money equals nominal GDP, which is the GDP deflator times real GDP.

> [!definition] Money Balance
> $M/P$ = real money balances = purchasing power of the money supply.
> Measure the purchasing power of the stock of money.

> [!formula] Money Demand Function
> $$\boxed{\left(M/P\right)^d = k \cdot Y}$$
> where $k$ = **how much money people wish to hold for each dollar of income**.

**NOTE**: this is **not** $M/P$ to some power, but rather the **demand for real money balances, denoted as $(M/P)^d$.**
This says that for a given level of real income $Y$, the quantity of real money balances demanded is proportional to $Y$.

> [!formula] Connection between velocity and money demand
> $$\boxed{k = \frac{1}{V}}$$

When people hold lots of money relative to their incomes ($k$ is large), money changes hands infrequently ($V$ is small).
$\quad \Rightarrow$ money demand parameter $k$ and velocity of money $V$ are opposite sides of the same coin.

## Quantity Theory of Money

Starts with Quantity Equation $M \cdot V = P \cdot Y$.
Assume that **velocity $V$ is constant** and exogenous: $V = \bar{V}$.

> [!formula] Quantity Theory of Money Equation
> $$\boxed{M \cdot \bar{V} = P \cdot Y}$$

-   Money supply $M$ determines nominal GDP $P \cdot Y$.
-   Real GDP $Y$ is determined by factors of production and technology (supply side).
-   The price level $P = NGDP/RGDP$ adjusts to ensure that the quantity equation holds.

![[images/13-real-nominal-price.jpg]]

The growth rate of a product equals the sum of the growth rates of its factors:

> [!definition] Money Growth Rate
> $$\text{money growth rate} = \frac{\Delta M}{M}$$

> [!formula] Growth Rate Form of Quantity Theory of Money
> $$\boxed{\frac{\Delta M}{M} + \frac{\Delta \bar{V}}{\bar{V}} = \frac{\Delta P}{P} + \frac{\Delta Y}{Y}}$$

Because the quantity theory of money assumes that velocity $\bar{V}$ is constant, its growth rate is zero: $\Delta \bar{V}/\bar{V} = 0$.
Thus, we have
$$ \frac{\Delta M}{M} = \frac{\Delta P}{P} + \frac{\Delta Y}{Y} $$

> [!formula] (Actual) Inflation Rate
> $$\text{Inflation Rate} = \frac{\Delta P}{P} = \boxed{\pi = \frac{\Delta M}{M} - \frac{\Delta Y}{Y}}$$

Normal economic growth requires a certain amount of money supply growth to facilitate the growth in transactions $T \approx P \cdot Y = RGDP$.
Money growth in excess of this amount leads to inflation.

> [!rule]
> The quantity theory predicts a one-for-one relationship between changes in the money growth rate $\Delta M/M$ and changes in the inflation rate $\pi$.

## Interest rates

> [!definition] Nominal Interest Rate
> The **nominal interest rate** $i$ is the interest rate that the **bank pays**.

> [!definition] Real Interest Rate
> The **real interest rate** $r$ is the **nominal interest rate adjusted for inflation**.
> It is the increase in your purchasing power from saving.

> [!formula] Real Interest Rate adjusted for Inflation
> $$\text{real interest rate } \boxed{r = i - \pi}, \qquad (i = \text{nominal interest rate}, \pi = \text{inflation rate})$$

> [!formula] Fisher Equation
> $$\boxed{i = r + \pi}$$

> [!definition] Fisher Effect
> We saw earlier that $S = I$ in the loanable funds market (where $I$ = investment) and that this determines the real interest rate $r$.
> Hence, an increase in the inflation rate $\pi$ causes an equal increase in the nominal interest rate $i$.
> This one-for-one adjustment of the nominal interest rate to the inflation rate is called the **Fisher effect**.

TODO: why is $S=I$ again?

> [!definition] Actual aInflation rate
> $$\text{actual inflation rate } = \pi = \frac{\Delta P}{P}$$
> Not known until **after it has occurred.**

> [!definition] Expected Inflation Rate
> $$\text{expected inflation rate } = E\pi$$
> The inflation rate that people **expect** to occur.

This leads to two definitions of the real interest rate:

> [!formula] Ex-ante Real Interest Rate
> $$\text{\textbf{ex-ante} real interest rate } = \boxed{i - E\pi}$$
> This is the real interest rate that people expect at the time they buy a bond or take out a loan.

> [!formula] Ex-post Real Interest Rate
> $$\text{\textbf{ex-post} real interest rate } = \boxed{i - \pi}$$
> This is the real interest rate actually realized.

## Money Demand Function

> [!formula] Money Demand Function
> $$\boxed{\left(M/P\right)^d = L(i, Y)}$$
> where
>
> -   $L$ = money demand function because money is *L*iquid asset
> -   $(M/P)^d$ = real money demand, which depends
> -   negatively on $i$ = nominal interest rate = opportunity cost of holding money
> -   positively on $Y$ = RGDP, because higher $Y$ increases spending on goods and services

Let's use the **ex-ante real interest rate** instead of the nominal interest rate:

> [!formula] Money Demand Function
> $$\boxed{\left(M/P\right)^d = L(i, Y) = L(r + E\pi, Y)}$$

## Equilibrium in the Money Market

> [!rule] Money Market Equilibrium
> $$\boxed{\frac{M}{P} = L(r + E\pi, Y)}$$
> Where LHS = supply of real money balances
> and RHS = real money demand

-   $M$ = exogenous (controlled by central bank)
-   $r$ = adjusts to ensure $S=I$
-   $Y$ $\rightarrow$ $\bar{Y} = F(\bar{K}, \bar{L})$

Price $P$ adjusts to ensure $\frac{M}{P} = L(i, Y)$.
A change in $M$ leads to a proportional change in $P$, just like in the quantity theory of money.

## The Classical Dichotomy

A dichotomy is a division into two parts.

> -   _nominal_ wage = dollars paid per hour of work
> -   _nominal_ interest rate $i$ = dollars paid in the future by borrowing one dollar today

In the real world, money is approximately neutral in the long run.

## Exchange Rates

> [!definition] Nominal Exchange Rate $e$
> The **nominal exchange rate** $e$ is the relative price of domestic currency in terms of a foreign currency.

> [!definition] Real Exchange Rate $\varepsilon$
> The **real exchange rate** $\varepsilon$ is the relative price of domestic goods in terms of foreign goods.

## Net Exports Function

> [!formula] Net Exports Function
> $$\boxed{NX = NX(\varepsilon)}$$

> [!definition] World Interest Rate
> The **world interest rate** $r^*$ is the real interest rate that prevails in the world economy.

The accounting identity says that $NX = S - I = NCO$.
We saw how $S - I$ is determined:

-   $S$ depends on domestic factors (output $Y$, fiscal policy variables ($G$ = government spending, $T$ = taxes))
-   $I$ is determined by the world interest rate $r^*$.

> [!formula] How $\varepsilon$ is determined
> $$\boxed{NX(\varepsilon) = \bar{S} - I(r^*)}$$

## Determinants of the Nominal Exchange Rate $e$

Start with the expression for the real exchange rate $\varepsilon$:

> [!formula] Real Exchange Rate
> $$\boxed{e = \frac{\varepsilon \cdot P}{P^*}}$$

Solve for $e$ to get

> [!formula] Nominal Exchange Rate
> $$\boxed{e = \varepsilon \cdot \frac{P^*}{P}}$$
> Where
>
> -   $\varepsilon$ = real exchange rate
> -   $P$ = domestic price level
> -   $P^*$ = foreign price level

Where $$\frac{M}{P} = L(r^* + \pi, Y), \qquad \frac{M^*}{P^*} = L(r^* + \pi^*, Y^*)$$

We can rewrite $e=\varepsilon \cdot \frac{P^*}{P}$ as $$\frac{\Delta e}{e} = \frac{\Delta \varepsilon}{\varepsilon} + \frac{\Delta P^*}{P^*} - \frac{\Delta P}{P} = \frac{\Delta e}{e} + \pi^* - \pi$$
