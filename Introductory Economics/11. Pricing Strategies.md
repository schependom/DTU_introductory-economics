## Simple Pricing Strategies

### Monopoly

If estimates of demand and cost functions are unavailable, managers have a crude estimate for

-   marginal cost
-   price elasticity of demand $E_F$ for a representative **F**irm in the market.

> [!formula] Monopoly profit-maximizing price
>
> $$\boxed{MC} = P\left(\frac{1+E_F}{E_F}\right)$$
>
> $$\boxed{MR} = P\left(1 + \frac{1}{E_F}\right)$$
>
> $$\boxed{P} = \frac{E_F}{1+E_F}MC$$

## Oligopoly

-   $N$ firms
-   Cournot oligopoly with similar products

> [!formula] Cournot oligopoly profit-maximizing price
> $$\boxed{P = \left(\frac{N \cdot E_M}{1 + N \cdot E_M}\right)MC}$$
> where $E_M$ is the market elasticity of demand.

## Strategies that yield even Greater Profits

3 categories in terms of pricing strategies:

1. extract surplus from customers
2. special cost and demand structures
3. markets with intense price competition

## 1. Surplus Extraction

### Price Discrimination

Charging different prices to different customers for the same good or service.

### First-Degree Price Discrimination (WTP)

> [!definition] First-Degree Price Discrimination
> Charging each customer their **maximum willingness to pay**.
> $\implies$ the firm **extracts all surplus from consumers** > $\implies$ the firm earns the **highest possible profit**.

Problem: managers rarely know each customer's willingness to pay.

### Second-Degree Price Discrimination (quantity)

> [!definition] Second-Degree Price Discrimination
> Charging different prices according to a **discrete schedule** of **declining prices** for different ranges of quantity purchased.
> $\implies$ the firm extract **some** surplus
> $\implies$ the firm doesn't need to know the identity of various consumers' demand

![[images/11-second-degree-pd.jpg]]

### Third-Degree Price Discrimination (elasticity)

> [!definition] Third-Degree Price Discrimination
> Charging different prices based on systematic differences in demand across **demographic consumer groups** > $\implies$ $MR$ will be different for each group
> $\implies$ for two groups, $MR_1 > MR_2$

### Two-Part Pricing

> [!definition] Two-Part Pricing
> Charging both
>
> -   a **fixed fee** for the right to purchase the good or service
> -   a **per-unit price** for each unit purchased.

![[images/11-two-part-pricing.jpg]]

$$P = 32 + 2Q = \text{Fixed Fee} + \text{Per-Unit Price} \cdot Q$$

### Block Pricing

> [!definition] Block Pricing
> Identitical products are **packaged together** in order to enhance profits by **forcing customers to make an all-or-none decision** to purchase.
> $\implies$ the profit-maximizing price on a package is the total value the consumer receives for the package.

![[images/11-block-pricing.jpg]]

### Commodity Bundling

> [!definition] Commodity Bundling
> Selling **two or more _different_ products together** and selling them at a single **"bundle price"**.
> $\implies$ key assumption: consumers have **different valuations (WTP)** for the products.
> $\implies$ managers cannot aboserve different consumers' valuations.

## 2. Special Cost and Demand Structures

### Peak-Load Pricing

> [!definition] Peak-Load Pricing
> Charging **higher prices during periods of peak demand** and **lower prices during periods of off-peak demand**.

![[images/11-peak-load.jpg]]

### Cross-Subsidies

> [!definition] Cross-Subsidies
> **Profits** gained from the **sale of one products** are to **subsidize sales of a related product**.

Cross-subsidization principle: Whenever the demands for two products produced by a firm are interrelated through costs or demand, the firm may enhance profits by cross-subsidization: selling one product at or below cost and the other product above cost.

### Transfer Pricing

> [!definition] Transfer Pricing
> A firm optimally sets the internal price at which an upstream division sells an input to a downstream division.

-   Most division managers are incentivized to maximize their own division's profits.
-   Transfer pricing aligns division managers' incentives with that of the overall firm: **increases overall firm profits**.

### Price Matching

> [!definition] Price Matching
> A firm advertises a price and a promise to match any lower price offered by a competitor.

-   Mitigate the stark outcome associated with firms competing in a homogeneous-rpdouct Bertrand oligopoly:
    -   TODO
-   Outcome:
    -   All firms can set monopoly price
    -   All firms earn monopoly profits
    -   Instead of the zero profits it twould earn in the usual one-shot Bertrand oligopoly

Potential issues:

-   dealing with false consumer claims of lower prices
-   competitors with lower cost structures

### Brand Loyalty

> [!definition] Brand Loyalty
> Brand loyal customers continue to buy a firms' product even if another firm offers a (slightly) better price.

-   To mitigate the tension of Bertrand competition
    -   TODO

Methods to introduce brand loyalty:

-   Advertising
-   Frequent-buyer programs

### Randomized Pricing

> [!definition] Randomized Pricing
> A firm intentionally **varies its price** in an attempt to "hide" price information from consumers and rivals.

Benefits to firms:

-   consumers cannot learn from experience which firm charges the lowest price on the market
-   reduces the ability of rival firms to undercut a firm's price

Not always profitable.
